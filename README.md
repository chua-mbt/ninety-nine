# 99 solutions for 99 scala problems

My personal solutions to [99 scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

This project is intended to demonstrate basic proficiency in the following:

* Functional Programming
* Scala
* Activator
* ScalaTest

Solutions can be tested using the activator test task.

```
activator test
```

Solutions for specific problem sets can be tested using test-only and an identifier in the package.

```
activator
> test-only *list*
> test-only *arithmetic*
```
